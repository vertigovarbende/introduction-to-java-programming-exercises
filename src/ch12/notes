notes

// introduction
# Exception handling enables a program to deal with exceptional situations and 
continue its normal execution.
# Runtime errors occur while a program is running if the JVM detects an operation that is 
impossible to carry out. 
# In Java, runtime errors are thrown as exceptions. An exception is an object that represents 
an error or a condition that prevents execution from proceeding normally. If the exception is 
not handled, the program will terminate abnormally

// key benefit
# This is typically the case for the library methods. The library method can detect the error, but only the caller 
knows what needs to be  done when an error occurs. The key benefit of exception handling is separating the detection 
of an error (done in a called method) from the handling of an error (done in the calling 
method)
